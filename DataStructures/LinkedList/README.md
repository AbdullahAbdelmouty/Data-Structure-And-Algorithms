# What is Linked List?
is a linear data structure similar to an array,However,Unlike arrays,elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index.
Rather each element is a separate object that contain a pointer or link to the next object in the list.
## An advantage of linked lists
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed, as they do not require contiguous memory allocation.
Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or end of a linked list is efficient, as it involves updating the references in the affected nodes.
Flexible Memory Allocation: Linked lists can be used when the memory allocation is not known in advance or needs to be managed dynamically.
Implementation of Other Data Structures: Linked lists serve as a foundation for implementing other complex data structures, such as stacks, queues, and graphs.
## Disadvantages of Linked lists
Sequential Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not offer direct random access to elements. Accessing a specific element requires traversing the list from the beginning until the desired node is reached.
Additional Memory Overhead: Linked lists require additional memory to store the references between nodes, which can result in higher memory usage compared to arrays for the same number of elements.
Reverse Traversal: While singly linked lists (with references to the next node only) can be traversed in one direction, reverse traversal or accessing the previous node requires a doubly linked list (with references to both the next and previous nodes).
# Types of Linkd Lists
Singly Linked lists: Each node contain only one pointer to the next node.
Doubly Linked Lists: Each node cotain two pointer on to the next node and other to the previous node.
Circular Linked List: Circular Linked Lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node point to first node or any other node before it.
# What is dummy head (or sentinel node)? 
is a commonly used technique in linked lists to simplify edge cases, such as inserting or deleting nodes at the beginning of the list. The dummy head is an extra node that doesn't hold any meaningful value but serves as a placeholder before the actual head of the list. It helps to avoid handling special cases where the head node itself changes during operations (like insertions or deletions).
